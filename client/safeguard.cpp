 * @brief Protect against unbounded recursion.
 *
 * It would be fairly easy for somebody to get confused in masquerade mode and
 * try to get distcc to invoke itself in a loop.  We can't always work out the
 * right thing to do but we can at least flag an error.
 *
 * This environment variable is set to guard against distcc accidentally
 * recursively invoking itself, thinking it's the real compiler.
