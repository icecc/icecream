icecc for Debian
----------------

The startup of iceccd and icecc-scheduler is now configured exclusively using
the init system.  This means that icecc-scheduler can be enabled at boot using
update-rc.d:
  # update-rc.d icecc-scheduler enable

Likewise, both iceccd (which is started by default) and icecc-scheduler
can be disabled using
  # update-rc.d iceccd disable
  # update-rc.d icecc-scheduler disable

Please refer to update-rc.d(8) for more information on update-rc.d usage.
