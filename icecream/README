How to install icecream
=======================

cd kdenonbeta/icecream/icecream
(make -f Makefile.cvs)
./configure --prefix=/opt/icecream
make
make install

WARNING: Make sure you specify a prefix, otherwise icecream
might override your gcc installation!

How to use icecream
===================

You need:

- One machine that runs the scheduler ("./scheduler &")
- Many machines that run the daemon ("./iceccd &")

If you want to compile using icecream, make sure $prefix/bin 
is the first first entry in your path, e.g. type

export PATH=/opt/icecream/bin:$PATH

Then you just compile with make -j <num>, where <num> is the amount
of jobs you want to compile in parallel. Don't exaggerate. Numbers
>15 normally cause trouble.

If you want funny stats, you might want to run "icemon".

Enjoy!
