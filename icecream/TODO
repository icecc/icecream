* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
* keep better track of currently installing daemons (matz)
* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* daemon: install and use build root
   as user: (not sure it's worth it)
      chown 0 lib/libc.so*
      PATH=$PWD/usr/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib:/lib usr/bin/gcc -B/tmp/test/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.1/ -c ~/test.ii
* better support for gcc installations not in /usr - for example in allowing the distcc way
  icecc /opt/gcc-cvs/bin/g++ -c test.cpp (you would need to rely on $ICECC_VERSION then as
  the daemon can hardly know what compiler you used, but that should be ok)

Features for paranoid users (hi Chris):
  - bind the broadcast listener to fixed local port (8765) (otherwise not firewallable)
  - chmod TMPDIR/native, as otherwise set umask prevent it from being readable
    by the client
