* daemon: install and use build root
   as user: 
      chown 0 lib/libc.so*
      PATH=$PWD/usr/bin LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib:/lib usr/bin/gcc -B/tmp/test/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse-linux/3.3.1/ -c ~/test.ii
* client: if the is interrupted, remove the job from the CS
* server: if the client is cancelled, there might be jobs that reside in the joblist
  even though the daemon never heared of them - timeout!
* monitor: easier monitor views
* client: let the client have run the job on two different servers for every 10th or 100th job
* all: protocol version
* scheduler, daemon: handle multiple environments

IDEAS:
* provide a way to pass jobs through the scheduler for multihomed servers
