* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware

* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* daemon: install and use build root
   as user: (not sure it's worth it)
