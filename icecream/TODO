Release Critical:
* keep better track of currently installing daemons (matz)
* bind the broadcast listener to fixed local port (8765) (otherwise not firewallable)
* chmod TMPDIR/native, as otherwise set umask prevent it from being readable by the client
   I'm wondering if it doesn't make sense to leave the daemon out of the game and let the
   client package the environment - it could either cache it in /tmp and leave a note in
   ~/.icecream or it packages it right into ~/.icecream and use e.g. the inode numbers of
   the compilers to verify it's the right environment - think NFS users changing machines.
   This would simplify some things and avoid the above bugs (and it would make it more
   convenient for users of /opt/gcc-cvs/bin too)
* Improve Documentation (cschum)

Dream Mode:
* daemon: run without chroot rights (not sure it's worth it)
      as we can't overwrite the ld-linux.so, we would need to call all binaries ourselves.
      E.g. PATH=/ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib lib/ld-linux.so usr/bin/gcc -print-prog-name=cc1
        parse that output and use it for -B
      PATH=/ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/usr/lib lib/ld-linux.so usr/bin/gcc -B $basepath -v test.ii -finvalid-opt
        parse that output and use the command line used (remove -pipe from the options)
      E.g.
      lib/ld-linux.so $basepath/cc1plus -fpreprocessed test.ii -quiet -dumpbase test -auxbase test -version -o test.s
      ... you figured here it's just too ugly to be worth it
  - I tried on Matz's suggestion to put wrapper scripts in place, but g++ does an execve on cc1plus and so the system
    shell (/bin/sh) is interpreted by the environment's ld-linux.so - causing the kind of problems we wanted to avoid.
    There are two solutions to _that_ problem I guess: packaging /bin/sh too (ugly) or making the wrapper not scripts
    but small binaries compiled on the client machine (ugly too)

Random:
* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* keep the environment cache dir under a configurable limit
