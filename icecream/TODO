Release Critical:
* keep better track of currently installing daemons (matz)
* bind the broadcast listener to fixed local port (8765) (otherwise not firewallable) (matz)
* chmod TMPDIR/native, as otherwise set umask prevent it from being readable by the client
   I'm wondering if it doesn't make sense to leave the daemon out of the game and let the
   client package the environment - it could either cache it in /tmp and leave a note in
   ~/.icecream or it packages it right into ~/.icecream and use e.g. the inode numbers of
   the compilers to verify it's the right environment - think NFS users changing machines.
   This would simplify some things and avoid the above bugs (and it would make it more
   convenient for users of /opt/gcc-cvs/bin too)
* Improve Documentation (cschum)
* I'm not sure but I think we need to lock the local host _before_ we fork off the notification
  child. Otherwise the gantt view explodes :)
* make the protocol version an uint32, not a hand-build array.
* Sometimes the daemon loses jobs.  I noticed very run longing cc1 but the scheduler
  didn't know about them anymore.  The client disconnected, hence the job was stoped
  but somehow either the daemon didn't get this.  Perhaps a network hickup, were
  clients connection to scheduler broke, but not to daemon.  Anyway the daemon
  wasn't killing this job, although it was an orphan.
  --> make the scheduler inform the daemon about such stop, so it can react.

Random:
* Option -iiface to specify the interface[s] to listen on for the scheduler, or
  to use for the daemon.
* Don't explicitly forbid tunnels because it could be useful for things like
  vmware
* If someone calls a amd64 client on a host that runs a ia32 daemon and there are
  no other amd64 daemons in the farm, he will get no answer, but a timeout from
  scheduler (quite a corner case, but neat)
* keep the environment cache dir under a configurable limit
