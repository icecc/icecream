0.7.11 (r581076):
       - fix a crash in the daemon when the scheduler was gone while
         local jobs were waiting for finishing
       - separate stat handling from ping handling
         to avoid excessive stat/ping loops
         (increases internal version number)
       - only reset scheduler ping time if the scheduler ping'ed us
       - even when we can't determine native environment, we
         can still use the daemon for inter-process locking
         instead of falling back to file locking.
       - quicker reap of dead daemons
       - improved load guessing
       - fix stupid logic bug in ping tracking

0.7.10 (r580794):
	- handle errors in installing environments correctly
        - block daemons that have full discs
        - add -pipe to the command line to reduce disk usage
        - fix cancelling of jobs awaiting a remote job (were hanging
          in scheduler forever)
        - if ICECC=no is set, don't try to be clever
        - adding two more flags for local compilation (profile
          feedback related)
        - flush debug files before every fork to avoid dups in
          log output
        - be stricter in what messages are required to keep the
          daemon<->scheduler communication intact (network drops
          again)

0.7.9 (r580498):
	- scheduler will ping the daemon periodically,
	  daemon will disconnect if not pinged from time
          to time (to avoid network drops being unnoticed)
	- removed some debug output
	- make logging more consistent
	- increased internal protocol version (still compatible)
	- try even harder to avoid races in daemon
	- rework how clients are catched
	- some random cleanup
	- remove the "this should be an exception" output to
	  avoid failing configure checks for nothing
	- make sure the assembler is dead before we cleanup object
	  files

0.7.8 (r579795):
        - fd leak fix, which caused a deadlock under 
          certain conditions
        - rework some FreeBSD patches that caused problems
	- fix race between select and SIGCHILD

0.7.7 (r574260):
	- clear all internal maps
	- patches by Frerich to support FreeBSD
	- avoid busy loop in bizarre conditions
	- found another case of endless hanging jobs
	- some process fixes

0.7.6 (r561764):
	- report all daemon error message to the client
	- fix support for biarch machines that have only one
	  environment installed with another environment with
          the same name and different architecture being around
        - work-around a bug in older libstdc++
        - ensure nobody uses -u root

0.7.5 (r561480):
	- don't block while looking for a scheduler over broadcast search.
	- fix logrotate
	- immediately kick broken daemon connections

0.7.4 (r559927):
	- Add -fpreprocessed argument
	- Fix daemons getting stuck after a while with 100% CPU
	- fix for kubuntu where libs are deeply nested 
          such as /lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6
	- find the compiler even though icecc wasn't in the path
	- fix deletion of old environments
	- a lot more error handling
	- fix assertion failures in daemon upon sigchild delivery
	- use -fPIC also for C files
	- avoid race between local and remote daemon about who has
	  the right exit status
	- rename the package to icecc

0.7.3 (r552930):
	- more work on error handling
	- corrected icecc --help output
	- handle local icecream load correctly
	- reduce the number of load updates from daemon to scheduler
	- early launch the compiler even before the whole preprocessed 
          file has been received
	- handle low-latency networks better
	- builtin colorgcc
	- let the daemon schedule local load even without scheduler (important
	  for multi processor machines)

0.7.2 (r549574): 
	- split out libicecream-devel for the monitor
	- introducing ICECC_PREFERRED_HOST (=mybigfathost) to let the scheduler
          ignore all rules - this is meant to be a debugging aid
	- fix network performance between client and local daemon
	- replaced create-env with icecc --build-native (respecting the user's 
          $PATH by default)

0.7.1 (r548846):	
	- Monitor is an extra package now
	- don't make non-existant cross compilers fatal, but just use
          the other environments in ICECC_VERSION
	- always handle aborted syscalls
	- update minilzo
	- never exit() or return from fork()'ed code paths,
	 
0.7.0 (r547196):
        - WARNING: the protocol is not compatible with earlier versions, old clients
          will refuse to connect, so update the full farm

	- protocol reworked to no longer require a client->scheduler connection
           (the daemon will proxy it all)
        - all local jobs are now scheduled by the local daemon to make sure 
          multiprocessor machines are handling as many jobs as they have jobs
          configured (# processors). They used to be "scheduled" by lock file
	- fixed grave bug that removed all daemon environments when the cache
	  grew over limit
	- new telnet interface command: internals to output daemon states
	- stricter error handling to avoid suprises
	- SIGHUP to daemon and scheduler will reopen the log file to allow logrotate
	- a restart of the daemon and scheduler won't flush the log file, but append
	  to it
	- create-env will create .tar.gz now - the client allows environments to be
	  .tar, .tar.bz2 and .tar.gz
