NOTE: Although icecream will compile on some non-Linux systems,
it depends critically on Linux' /proc/ structures and will fail
at runtime until somebody figures out how to emulate the "ticks"
form of process accounting in there.

How to install icecream
=======================

cd kdenonbeta/icecream/icecream
(make -f Makefile.cvs)
./configure --prefix=/opt/icecream
make
make install

WARNING: Make sure you specify a prefix, otherwise icecream
might override your gcc installation!

Please have a look at http://wiki.kde.org/icecream - the docu 
is maintained there for the time being
