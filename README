NOTE: Although icecream will compile on some non-Linux systems,
it depends critically on Linux' /proc/ structures and will fail
at runtime until somebody figures out how to emulate the "ticks"
form of process accounting in there.

How to install icecream
=======================

cd icecream
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/opt/icecream
make
make install

WARNING: Make sure you specify a prefix, otherwise icecream
might override your gcc installation! You will need to use this
prefix instead of /usr when referring to icecream (for example
when extending the $PATH variable).

The documentation is maintained in README.md for the time being.
