Name
----
icerun - Icecream custom command wrapper


Synopsis
--------
*icerun* [_command_] [_command options_]


Description
-----------
Icerun is the Icecream custom command wrapper. It simply executes the passed
command, but limits the number of parallel invocations the same way local compilations
are limited. Since builds using Icecream usually require increasing the parallelism
of a build, wrapping custom resource-demanding commands this way prevents these
commnads from overloading the system.
