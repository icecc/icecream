Name
----
icecc-create-env - Create an Icecream environment tarball


Synopsis
--------
*icecc-create-env* _compiler-binary_ [--addfile _file_]...


Description
-----------
Icecc-create-env is an Icecream helper that creates a new *.tar.gz*
archive with all the files (compiler, tools and libraries) needed to setup a
build environment.

The resulting archive has a random file name like *ddaea39ca1a7c88522b185eca04da2d8.tar.gz*,
which can then be renamed. See icecream(7) for more information on using the environment
tarballs.

NOTE: In the usual case it is not necessary to invoke `icecc-create-env` manually, as it will be
called automatically for the native compiler used whenever necessary.


Options
-------
*--addfile* _file_::
    Add _file_ to the environment archive, can be specified multiple times.
